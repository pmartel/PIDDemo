Notes on the rebuild of the PID demonstrator I made for the iRaiders

Over the summer of 2018, I took back the PID controller I made last summer.
I made 3D printed parts for the pivot and motor mount.  The motor mount was lighter than the old one, so it needs less lead to counterbalance.
On 8/12, I assembled the unit and tapped the pot shaft for a 6-32 screw, which makes the unit much steadier.  Unfortunately, the pot seems to be non-linear towards one end (high angles, low pot voltages) and goes to 0v at about 128 deg, 38 deg past vertical.  The pot turns to about 296 deg.  Also, as might be expected, the angle calibration from last summer is way off.  

I'm working to combine the PID Demo software with the older Controller Demo software which allows angle display, manual motor control and a primitive bang-bang controller.  It would make sense to add other capabilities, such as letting the operator hold a position while typing in an angle and then dumping a table of angle vs pot count.

It may help to put a resistor in series with the low side of the pot.  Try measuring the resistance vs angle (it's easy to measure the angle with a smartphone)

I got the angle table working.  Angle vs count looks reasonably linear until count "saturates" at 0 around 120 degrees.

On 8/14, I measured angle vs resistance after putting a paper shim in the hole for the pot's  tab to keep the pot from shifting.  The resistance is linear until it goes to 0.  There is still considerable turning after 0.

On 8/15 I removed the lead weight.  The weight imbalance amounted to 28 grams at the propeller, which is 41 cm from the pivot.  The other end to the pivot is 12.5 cm.  If we assume that any lead weight will effectively be at half that, 6.25 cm, it will take about 183 gm to balance the arm.  The lead coil weighs 166 gm and ends about 14 cm from the pivot.  The back end weighs 7 gm at this distance.
